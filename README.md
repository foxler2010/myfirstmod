## Disclaimer

I do not plan on expanding this mod feature-wise.
It was fun to learn how to mod by making smileys,
but this mod is done, and I will be moving on to other mods.

I hope my future work will incorporate more realistic gameplay
as I learn how to do more with mods, and strive to create
better gaming experiences.

This mod might be ported to future versions of the game,
so that I can learn the differences between versions.
Do not expect that to happen, though.

### Thank you for playing!
